This is awesome implementations of the Mapbox Vector Tile for Water Services Providers.

## Why Vectortiles?

> Vector tiles make huge maps fast while offering full design flexibility. They are the vector data equivalent of image tiles for web mapping, applying the strengths of tiling — developed for caching, scaling and serving map imagery rapidly — to vector data. (from [Mapbox website](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/)).

`Vectortiles` is the most popular and advanced mapping technology currently, its data is very light and fast, offering full design flexibility. 

Its operation cost is normally cheaper compare to raster tiles data distribution.

In Africa, Internet connection is still poor in some rural area. This vectortiles is right solution for such as poor internet situation. You can enjoy browsing smoothly in your computer or smartphones.

Our vectortiles approach uses Github pages without servers. I know it is quite difficult for some of water services providers to have servers in Africa. This toolkits were developed for you!

## Use Cases

The following websites are the final outputs of vector tiles maps for water sevices providers in both Kenya and Rwanda which are using this vector tiles toolkit.

1. [Water Supply Map for Narok Water, KENYA](https://narok.water-gis.com)
2. [Water Supply Map for WASAC RWSS, RWANDA](https://narok.water-gis.com)

The below is demo image of `Water Supply Map for WASAC RWSS`

You will see how this vectortiles is powerful for your water services providers.
